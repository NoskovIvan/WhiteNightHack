# About
Nowadays the number of electric cars is increasing every year. According to the study, it is assumed that by 2030, investment in electric cars will amount to $ 50 billion, and their share in the United States will be 14 percent of the total number of cars, and in Europe and China - more than 30 percent. Consequently, the need for chargers and parking places is growing. Our project "Smart Rechanger" easy solves these problems.



# Solution
Smart Rechanger is decentralized rechargers  parking network based on decentralised economic agents.

# How does it work? 

Any person or company can register in the application who has parking or charging stations and mark these places on the map. A driver who needs a parking or charging space can also register there and choose parking or charging and time which he needs. At the same time, a smart contract is immediately formed, which contains information about the driver, his arrival time and the cost of the service. The smart contract guarantees the driver that at the time he chooses a parking or charging space, the station owner is guaranteed that this will be paid.

Advantages of Smart Rechanger for drivers:

 - Driving car by optimal way
 - Focus on experience not on EV charger avaibility
 - Going directly to parking lot not wasting time to find one
 - Ability to compare prices andchoose the best fit

Advantages of Smart Rechanger for prorerty owners:

 - Additional cashflow from better utilising parking lots
 - Additional cashflow from EVcharger
 - Additional cashflow from crossselling
 - Simply to install equipment and low barrier to entry to market
 - All processes are automated

# Finally

During this hackathon, we reviewed the logic of the project, implemented smart contracts and developed an interface.
